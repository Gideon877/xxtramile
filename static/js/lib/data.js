                when he met Masixole. Masixole Faca has been doing music production since 2007. He
                started producing deep house and tribal music. He spend time listening to international
                house music and decide adapt from it. He began to produce Deep Tech, Techno and

                They have made a research in the global scene and downloaded more of Electro, Techno
                music gathering as much possible information they find and attending electronic music
                events. They also made a research in the local scene since their style of music was not
                appreciated Then the Duo had time to invent a new style. They have decided to fuse all
                the sounds of Techno, African and Electro to create a new taste that will accommodate
                more nations and which they believe it is truly expressing their love for music. <br><br>
